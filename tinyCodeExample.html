        Open the Chrome Developer Tools and look in the Console. You should see
        a Float32 arrray produced by multiplying a deeplearn array by a deeplearn scalar.

    <!-- The script below runs a computation with the Array1D
    and Scalar structures from deeplearnjs.  Deeplearnjs runs the computation
    runs on the computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit),
    which is much faster than running on the CPU.  The speed
    difference is irrelevant for this tiny example, but will
    becoe critical for computing-intense applications, such as
    training neural networks. -->

        // changed the vector and the scalar multipliers
        const a = deeplearn.Array1D.new([2, 4, 5]);
